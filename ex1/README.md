## Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression

### Requirement
 - numpy
 - matplotlib

### Linear regression with one variable

```
python ex1.py
```

#### Problem description
 - In this part of this exercise, you will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 
 - Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.

#### [Data](ex1data1.txt)

 - First column refers to the population size in 10,000s
 - Second column refers to the profit in $10,000s

### Linear regression with multiple variables

```
python ex1_multi.py
```

#### Problem description

 - In this part, you will implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. 
 - Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices.

#### [Data](ex1data2.txt)

 - First column of x refers to the size of the house (in square feet)
 - Second column of x refers to the number of bedrooms
 - y refers to the price of house
